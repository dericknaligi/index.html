        <h1>The Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>In Nairobi, <abbr title="gender-based violence">GBV</abbr> remains a critical barrier to women's  empowerment. <br>
            <br> Approximately 47% of women aged 15-49 experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime <br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2020). <br>
        <br> &nbsp;This pervasive issue causes severe physical and psychological harm,<br>
        <br> perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality that limit women's access to education,<br>
        <br> economic opportunities, and participation in decision-making processes ( <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Women, 2021) <br>
    <br>Despite existing legal frameworks and initiatives aimed at addressing GBV,<br> 
    <hr> 
    <br> <strong> societal stigma,</strong> cultural norms, and inadequate support systems prevent many survivors <br>
    <br> from seeking help and reclaiming their agency (Human Rights Watch, 2020). <br>
    <br> Addressing GBV is crucial for creating a safer and more equitable society,<br>
    <br> enabling women to thrive and contribute meaningfully to their communities <br>
    <br> (National Council on Gender and Development, 2021).  <br>
